A Framework to Visually Represent Material Science Engineering Methods and RDF Knowledge Graph Creation


An approach for Visual representation of Material Science Methods and Knowledge Graph generation, which has become highly attractive for boosting research endeavors in the materials science and Semantic Web domain. The work is presented in a framework format to visually organize the Material Science Methods and generate an RDF Knowledge Graph to allow users to obtain essential information, such as provenance, and reproduce the experiments. The framework is built over free platforms, open-source and free software, such as diagrams.net and Chowlk.
